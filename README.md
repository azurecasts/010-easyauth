# AzureCasts #010: Authentication with App Services and EasyAuth

Yes, yes I know I can "just use Passport" with a Node/Express application, but I wanted to explore what Azure's Auth service, informally known as EasyAuth, has to offer. In this video I turn the service on and setup login, logout, personalization and finally lockdown of protected resources. I had fun!

The code for this episode is organized in a "start/final" format, so you can see the solution and play along from scratch if you want. Please note: _this aint gonna work on localhost!_. The site will run, but logins etc need to be up on your own domain.
